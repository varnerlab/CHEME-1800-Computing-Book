## Functions

Most of us are familiar with the idea of a function from mathematics ({numref}`fig-mathematical-function`). A mathematical function takes input from a collection of possible inputs (called the domain) and maps this input to a set of outputs that lives in a group of possible outcomes (called the range). The function itself $f$ is the rule that describes how the inputs are transformed into results, while $y = f(x)$ denotes the output value in the range of the function $f$.

Functions on the computer share many of the features of mathematical functions, but there are a few crucial differences. For example, on the computer, a function is an object that maps a tuple of arguments to a tuple of return values. However, unlike mathematical functions, functions in languages such as [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) or [Python](https://www.python.org) can alter and be affected by the global state of the program.


## Iteration
One of the most common programming tasks you will do is iterating over a list of items. For example, suppose you wanted to see all the items on a To Do list for a day.
