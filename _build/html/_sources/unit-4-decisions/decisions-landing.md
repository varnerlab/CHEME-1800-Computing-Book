# The Decision Problem: Probability, Random Process, and Decisions
The decision problem is a framework for making choices in the face of uncertainty. It is essential in fields such as statistics, economics, and computer science. Here is an introduction to some of the key concepts that are related to the decision problem:

Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 representing an impossible event and 1 representing a particular event. Probability can be used to help make decisions when the outcomes of a decision are uncertain.

A random process is a sequence of events that are generated randomly. Random processes are used to model situations where the outcome is uncertain or unknown. They are often used to study systemsâ€™ behavior over time and predict future events.

Decisions are choices that are made in the face of uncertainty. Decision-making can be difficult because it involves balancing the potential outcomes of different actions and choosing the most likely to lead to a desirable result.
