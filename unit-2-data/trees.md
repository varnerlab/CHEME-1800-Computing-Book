# Data Structures

## Introduction
In this set of lectures, we'll introduce Data Structures and methods to access the data stored in data structures. Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data structures are suited to various applications; some are highly specialized for specific tasks. Some common examples of data structures that we will discuss include the following:

### Linear data structures
* {ref}`content:references:lda-arrays`: An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The items can be of any data type, and each item has a unique index that can be used to access it. 
* {ref}`content:references:lda-stacks` and {ref}`content:references:lda-queues` are array like data structues that control how elements are added and accessed. {ref}`content:references:lda-stacks` follows the 
[last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)). This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are often used to store data temporarily while a program is executing. {ref}`content:references:lda-queues` follow the [first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)), the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Queues are often used to store data that needs to be processed in a specific order or to store data that is being transferred from one place to another.
* {ref}`content:references:lda-linked-lists`: A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is a separate object, connected to the next element by a pointer; linked lists store sequences of items, which can be expanded or contracted as needed.

### Non-linear data structures
* {ref}`content:references:data-structure-hashmap-and-sets`: A hashmap is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each key value is unique. Sets are similar to hashmaps but only store keys and do not have values associated with them.
* {ref}`content:references:data-structure-tree`: A tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has one or more child nodes. Trees are used to store data that has a natural hierarchical structure, such as the structure of a file system or the organization of a company.
* {ref}`content:references:data-structure-graphs`: A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges connecting the vertices. Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects, and they are often used to model networks.

### Graph Traversal
Finally, we'll also introduce approaches to access the data in trees and graphs. In particular, we'll discuss:

* {ref}`content:references:data-structure-graphs-depth-first` is a graph traversal algorithm that visits vertices by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Depth-first starts at a source vertex and explores the graph in a depth-first manner, visiting every vertex reachable from the source. This algorithm is often implemented using recursion but can also be implemented iteratively using a stack.

* {ref}`content:references:data-structure-graphs-breadth-first` is a graph traversal algorithm that visits vertices in order of their distance from a source vertex. Breadth-first starts at a source vertex and explores all the vertices at the same level before moving on to vertices at the next level. This algorithm is often implemented using a queue to keep track of the vertices to be visited.

## Linear data structures
Linear data structures store elements linearly, meaning that they are arranged in a sequence one after the other. This contrasts with non-linear data structures, which do not have a strict sequential order.

(content:references:lda-arrays)=
### Arrays
An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items of the same type in a _contiguous_ block of memory ({numref}`fig-array-schematic`). The name of an array, e.g., $a$ points to the first element, then each subsequent element in the array adds `+1` units to the memory address of the previous element.   

```{figure} ./figs/Fig-Array-Schematic.pdf

height: 90px
name: fig-array-schematic
---

```

The items in an array are accessed using an index, an integer representing the itemâ€™s position in the collection. In most programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed, i.e., the first element in the array has an index of `0`, the second element has an index of `1`, and so on. However, arrays in [Julia](https://julialang.org) are one-based, i.e., the first element has an index `1`, the second element has an index `2`, etc. 

Arrays can store large amounts of data because they allow fast access to any element using the index. Elements of an array are typically indexed using `bracket notation` in most languages such as [Julia](https://julialang.org) or [Python](https://www.python.org):

```{code-cell} julia
# Define an array -
a = [2,4,8,16,32,64]

# What is the 3rd element of the array a?
i = 3
println("The third element of a = $(a[i])")
```

However, array access uses parenthesis in niche systems, such as [Matlab/Octave](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). 

Accessing individual elements or contiguous ranges of elements of an array is fast, but inserting or deleting elements from the middle of an array can be slow, as it requires shifting the elements to make room for the new element or closing the gap left by the deleted element.

#### Types of arrays: Vectors, Matrices and d-dimensional arrays
There are different sizes (types) of arrays, such as one-dimensional arrays (vectors), which store a linear sequence of elements, and multi-dimensional arrays, e.g., two-dimensional arrays (matricies) or arrays of arrays that store data in more complex structures.

In [Julia](https://julialang.org), the size of an array and the type of data that will be stored in the array are declared when you initialize the array. For example, a 1-dimensional array of indefinite length that holds integers is declared as: 

```{code-cell} julia
# Define an array arr
arr = Array{Int64,1}() # the array is empty

# When an array has undefined length, we use the push! operation to add values
push!(arr,1); # adds a 1 to index 1
push!(arr,2); # adds a 2 to index 2
push!(arr,4); # adds a 4 to index 3

# print elements of the array -
println("Elements of arr = $(arr)")
```

Of course, if you know how many elements you need the array to store beforehand, you can declare that when the array is constructed:

```{code-cell} julia
# Define an array arr
arr = Array{Int64,1}(undef, 10) # the array has 10 elements, each initialized to undefined

# When an array has defined length, we use the = operation to add values
for i in 1:10
  arr[i] = 2^i # fills the array with powers of 2
end

# print elements of the array -
println("Elements of arr = $(arr)")
```

Two-dimensional arrays follow a similar pattern when we declare the array; however, there is no direct equivalent to the `push!` operation for two- (or higher) dimensional arrays. Thus, when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays, we typically need to know the size of each dimension when we declare the array:

```{code-cell} julia
# Define an 2-dimensional array A
A = Array{Int64, 2}(undef, 4, 4) # array of Int's has 4 rows, 4 cols, initialized to undefined

# When an array has defined length, we use the = operation to add values
# This creates an upper-triangular matrix with powers 2
for i in 1:4
  for j in 1:4
    if (i<=j)
      A[i,j] = 2^j # fills the array with powers of 2 along the col index
    else
      A[i,j] = 0 # adds a zero
    end
  end
end

# print elements of the array
A
```

#### Other array like data structures: Stacks and Queues

(content:references:lda-stacks)=
##### Stacks
A `stack` data structure follows the [last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), the last element added to a `stack` will be the first element removed ({numref}`fig-stack-schematic`). Unlike an array, you cannot access the elements of a stack by thier index. Instead, elements are added to the top of the stack (also known as `pushing`) and removed from the top of the stack (also known as `popping`). 


```{figure} ./figs/Fig-Stack-Schematic.pdf
---
height: 200px
name: fig-stack-schematic
---
Schematic of the `push!` and `pop!` operations for a `stack s`. Stacks follow the last-in, first-out paradigm. Thus, new elements are continually added to the top of the stack, while elements are drawn from the top (depicted with the dashed arrow).
```
Stacks in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) are implemented in the [DataStructures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl) package:

```julia
using DataStructures # import the DataStructures package

# create an empty Stack that holds Int64 values
s = Stack{Int64}()

# add some values to the Stack using the push! operation
push!(s, 1);
push!(s, 2);
push!(s, 3);

# Grab a value from the Stack using the pop! operation
x = pop!(s);

# print x
println("What value did we get from the Stack = $(x)")
```

In this example, the elements `1`, `2`, and `3` are added to the `stack s` using the `push!` operation. The `pop!` operation removes the top element of the `stack`, i.e., the value 3 (the last item added); thus, `pop!` removes elements from the `stack` in the _opposite order_ they were added. 

###### Common uses of Stacks:
* __Function call stack__: In programming languages, the function [call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack) is typically implemented as a stack data structure. Each time a function is called, its information (such as local variables, parameters, and return address) is pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, its information is popped off the stack, allowing the program to resume execution from where it left off.
* __Undo/redo functionality__: Many applications that allow users to undo and redo actions use a stack data structure to keep track of the actions. Each time a user acts, such as typing a letter or moving an object, the action is added to the stack. The most recent activity is popped off the stack and undone when the user chooses to undo an action. Similarly, the redo functionality pushes undone actions back onto the stack.
* __Expression evaluation__: Stack data structures can also be used to evaluate mathematical expressions, such as those in postfix notation. Operands are pushed onto the stack in this case, and operators are applied to the most recently pushed operands. The result is then pushed back onto the stack until the entire expression has been evaluated.
 
(content:references:lda-queues)=
##### Queues
The `queue` data structure follows the [first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)), the first element added to the `queue` will be the first element to be removed ({numref}`fig-queue-schematic`). In a `queue`, elements are added to the bottom (also known as _enqueuing_) and removed from the top (also known as _dequeuing_). 

```{figure} ./figs/Fig-Queue-Schematic.pdf
---
height: 200px
name: fig-queue-schematic
---
Schematic of the `enqueue!` and `dequeue!` operations for a `queue q`. Quues follow the first-in, first-out paradigm. Thus, new elements are continually added to the bottom of the queue, while elements are drawn from the top (depicted with the dashed arrow).
```

Queues in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) are implemented by the [DataStructures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl) package:

```julia
using DataStructures # import the DataStructures package

# create an empty Queue that holds Int64 values
q = Queue{Int64}()

# add some values to the Queue using the enqueue! operation
enqueue!(q, 1);
enqueue!(q, 2);
enqueue!(q, 3);

# Grab a value from the Queue using the dequeue! operation
x = dequeue!(q);

# print x
println("What value did we get from the Queue = $(x)")

```

In this example, the elements `1`, `2`, and `3` are added to the `queue q` in that order using the `enqueue!` operation. The `dequeue!` operation removes the top element from the `queue`, i.e., the value `1` (the first item added); `dequeue!` removes elements from the `queue` in the order they were added. 

###### Common uses of Queues
* __Job scheduling__: Queues are often used in operating systems to manage tasks, such as running programs or printing documents. Each task is placed in a queue, and the operating system schedules tasks in the order they were added to the queue, allowing tasks to be processed in the order they were received.
* __Breadth-first search__: In graph theory, the breadth-first search algorithm explores a graph by visiting all the vertices at a given level before moving on to the next level. This can be implemented using a queue data structure, where the vertices at each level are added to the queue in order and processed in that exact order.
* __Message passing__: Queues are often used to pass messages between different parts of a system, such as between a producer and a consumer in a messaging system. Messages are added to the back of the queue by the producer and consumed from the front of the queue by the consumer. This allows the producer and consumer to operate at different speeds without the risk of messages being lost or overwritten.

In addition to the applications listed above, Queues are an ideal data structure for recursive parsing applications. Let's build a recursive string parser using a Queue ({prf:ref}`example-queue-recursive-string-parser`):

````{prf:example} Recursive descent string parser
:class: dropdown
:label: example-queue-recursive-string-parser

Develop a recursive parser that returns the words in a sentence as a `Dict{Int64, String}`, where the keys are the index of the word in the sentence, and the value are the words.

Test input: "you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . "

__Solution__: We'll encode the string we need to parse in a queue data structure. We'll process each character until the queue is empty (base case): i) if the character is not the delimiter, then we'll store it; ii) if the character is the delimiter, we'll assemble all the characters that we stored into a string add to the external array.

__Assumptions__: This code assumes that the `DataStructures.jl` package has been installed; the `DataStructures.jl` implements the `Queue` data structure.

```julia
# load external packages -
using DataStructure

"""
    _recursive_parser(q::Queue, s::Array{Char,1}, a::Array{String,1}; delim = ' ')
"""
function _recursive_parser(q::Queue, s::Array{Char,1}, a::Array{String,1}; 
    delim = ' ')

    # base case: we have no more characters in the character_arr - we are done
    if (isempty(q) == true)
        return nothing 
    else

        # grab the next_char -
        next_char = dequeue!(q)
        if (next_char == delim)
            
            # if we get here, then we have hit a delim character, this means we should
            # turn the characters in the s array into a word
            # join chars in the character array -
            word = join(s)
            if (isempty(word) == false)
                push!(a,word) # add that word to our word list -
            end

            # empty out the array of characters, because we may need it again
            empty!(s);
        else

            # if we get here, next_char is *not* the delim, so push next_char into the array
            # Why? we are collecting next_char until we hit a delim or hit the base case
            # When we hit a delim the characters in s can be joined to make a word
            push!(s, next_char)
        end

        # process the next character in the queue -
        _recursive_parser(q,s,a; delim = delim);
    end
end

"""
    recursive_parser(string::String; delim::Char=' ') -> Dict{Int64,String}
"""
function recursive_parser(string::String; 
    delim::Char=' ')::Dict{Int64,String}

    # initialize -
    d = Dict{Int,String}()
    a = Array{String,1}()
    s = Array{Char,1}()
    q = Queue{Char}()
    counter = 0

    # build the Queue q that we are going to parse -

    end

    # convert to dictionary for the output

    end

    # return -
    return d

<!-- 
Queues are often used to store data that needs to be processed in a specific order or to store data that is being transferred from one place to another. For example, a printer `queue` might store print jobs that need to be printed in the order they were received, or a task `queue` might store tasks that need to be completed by a group of workers. -->

### Linked lists
Linked lists are a common alternative to arrays because they can be resized easily; ndoes can be inserted or removed without moving the other nodes.
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, is a separate object that stores a data value and a reference (link) to the next node in the list ({numref}`fig-LinkedList-schematic`). 


```{figure} ./figs/Fig-LinkedList-Schematic.pdf
---
height: 180px
name: fig-LinkedList-schematic
---
Schematic of a singly linked list. Each node in the list has data, in this case a queue data structure, and a reference (link) to the next node in the list. 
```

There are two main types of linked lists: singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node has a reference to the next node in the list but not the previous one. On the other hand, each node connects to the next and previous nodes in a doubly linked list.

#### Common uses of linked lists
Linked lists are often used when the data structure size is not known in advance or when the data needs to be inserted or removed frequently, as the time complexity for these operations is constant for a linked list.

* __Dynamic data structures__: Linked lists are helpful when working with data structures that can change in size during runtime. Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink as needed without complex memory management or copying operations. This makes them helpful in implementing stacks, queues, and other dynamic data structures.
* __Memory allocation__: In computer memory management, linked lists are used to keep track of free and allocated memory blocks. Each memory block is represented as a node in the list, with a pointer to the next block. This allows the system to find a suitable block for a new allocation quickly and to free up blocks when they are no longer needed efficiently.
* __Modeling hierarchical data__: Linked lists can represent hierarchical data structures, such as trees and graphs. Each node in the list represents a tree node or graph vertex and contains a pointer to its children or neighbors. This allows the data to be stored and manipulated flexibly and efficiently while maintaining the hierarchical structure.

Linked lists can also implement {ref}`content:references:lda-stacks` and {ref}`content:references:lda-queues`. Let's consider an example [Julia](https://julialang.org) implementation of a stack-based upon a linked list ({prf:ref}`example-linked-list-stack`):


````{prf:example} Linked-list implementation of a Stack
:label: example-linked-list-stack
:class: dropdown

Develop a stack data structure that holds characters using a linked list. 

__Solution__: Let's implement our character stack by defining the `Node` and `Stack` types and the `push!` and `pop!` operations in a file called `Stack.jl` (in the `src` directory):

```julia
"""
Mutable node type for the linked list stack implementation
"""
mutable struct Node
    
    # data
    value::Char
    next::Union{Nothing, Node}

    # constructor -
    Node() = new();
end

"""
Mutable stack type
"""
mutable struct Stack
    head::Union{Nothing, Node}
end

"""
    push!(stack::Stack, value::Char)

Implements the push! operation for our linked list stack 
"""
function push!(stack::Stack, value::Char)
    
    # create a new node -
    new_node = Node()
    new_node.value = value;       # set the data value on the node
    new_node.next = stack.head;   # set the reference to the next item in the ll 

    # set the head ot the stack to the new node 
    stack.head = new_node
end

"""
    pop!(stack::Stack)

Implements the pop! operation for our linked list stack
"""
function pop!(stack::Stack)
    
    # if we don't have any more chars, then throw an error
    if stack.head === nothing # whay the === and not ==?
        throw("Stack is empty") # "throw" an error
    end
    
    # grabs the value held by the current head
    value = stack.head.value

    # updates the head reference to the next item in the stack
    stack.head = stack.head.next
    
    # return the char value
    return value
end
```



To build our stack, we can add the following code to a `runme.jl` file (in the root directory) where we have assumed our standard example/project structure (paths, packages, and our codes included in an `Include.jl` file in the root):


```julia
# include the Include -
include("Include.jl")

# create a new an empty stack -
s = Stack(nothing);

# add characters to the stack -
text = "Roomba!"
char_array = collect(text);
for c âˆˆ char_array
    push!(s,c)
end
```

__source__: Source code can be found in the [CHEME-1800/4800 tree examples repository](https://github.com/varnerlab/CHEME-1800-4800-Course-Repository-S23/tree/main/examples/unit-2-examples/linked_list_stack)

````

## Non-linear data structures
Non-linear data structures store and manage data in more complex ways, allowing for faster access and manipulation of data, especially data with hierarchical relationships.  However, while non-linear data structures can be more efficient than arrays and linked lists, they are typically more complex to construct and require more memory.

<!-- Let's consider a few handy non-linear data structures, {ref}`content:references:data-structure-hashmap-and-sets`, {ref}`content:references:data-structure-tree`, and {ref}`content:references:data-structure-graphs`.  -->

(content:references:data-structure-hashmap-and-sets)=
### Dictionary and sets
A dictionary stores key-value pairs, where each key value is unique. Dictionaries use a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) to map keys (which can be a variety of types) to an array index. Thus, dictionaries have efficient lookup and insertion operations. Sets are similar to dictionaries but only store keys and do not have values associated with them.

Dictionaries are implemented in both [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) as a `Dict` type; we've already seen several examples of [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) dictionaries when working with [JSON, TOML and YAML files](../unit-1-basics/data-file-io.md) or other examples. [Python](https://www.python.org) dictionaries behave in a similar way as thier [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) counterparts, with one important exception: in [Python > 3.7](https://www.python.org) dictionaries are _ordered_, while [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) dictionaries are always _unordered_.

Dictionaries are included in the standard libraries of Julia and Python; thus, they are available without importing external modules. Let's look at an examples of dictionaries in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org):

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} julia
```julia

# Initialize and empty dictionary, keys are strings, values can be anything
car = Dict{String,Any}()

# load key=value pairs into the dictionary
car["brand"] = "Ford"
car["model"] = "Mustang"
car["year"] = 1964
```
````

````{tab-item} python
```python
# Initialize and empty dictionary
car = {}

# Add data to car dictionary
car["brand"] = "Ford"
car["model"] = "Mustang"
car["year"] = 1964
```
````
`````

<!-- Data can be accessed by passing the key value into the dictionary, e.g., `car["brand"]` would return `Ford`. -->

Like dictionaries, both [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) implement a `Set` type in their respective standard libraries. The `Set` type holds a unique collection of keys but does not associate these keys with any data:

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} julia
```julia

# Initialize and empty set that stores strings
fruit = Set{String}()

# add items to a set using push!
push!(fruit, "Apple")
push!(fruit, "Pear")
push!(fruit, "Mango")
```
````

````{tab-item} python
```python
# Initialize an empty set
fruit = set()

# Add data to fruit set
fruit.add("Apple")
fruit.add("Pear")
fruit.add("Mango")
```
````
`````

In both [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org), the `Set` type is _unordered_; thus, unlike Arrays, Stacks or Queues, the order in which items are added to the set is not maintained. 

#### Hash functions
The exciting thing about a dictionary implementation, e.g., the `Dict` type in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org), is the fast lookup enabled by mapping an arbitrary key to an array index. This mapping is enabled using a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function). 

A [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) takes an input value, e.g., a string key, and returns a fixed-size string or number (hash value). The same key information will always produce the same index output, but even a small change to the input will have a very different result. In the case of a dictionary, when a key is passed to the hash function, it calculates a hash value, which is then used as the index at which the corresponding data value is stored in an array.

Let's look at some psuedo code for a simple hash function ({prf:ref}`algo-hash-function-code`):

````{prf:algorithm} Simple Hash Function
:label: algo-hash-function-code
:class: dropdown

**Inputs** String key, a size parameter, a $\beta$ factor

**Outputs** hash

**Initialize**
1. set hash $\leftarrow{0}$
1. set $L\leftarrow\text{length}(\text{key})$

**Main**
1. for $i\in{1,\dots,L}$
      1. hash $\leftarrow\left(\text{hash}\times\beta+\text{key}[i]\right)$ % size

**Return** hash
````

{prf:ref}`algo-hash-function-code` is a variant of Horner's hashing method when $\beta$ = 31. The [modulo operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) `%` computes the remainder, e.g., the expression `7 % 3` evaluates to `1`. The modulo `%` operation with `size` ensures that the output `hash` value is a valid index within the array. 

````{prf:example} Hashing example
:label: example-hashing-example-impl
:class: dropdown

Compute the hash value for the key = `CHEME-1800` for an array of `size` of `1000` and expansion factor $\beta$ = 31. 

__Solution__: We implemented {prf:ref}`algo-hash-function-code` in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org). The `myhash` function takes a string key as input and has optional default values for the $\beta$ and `size` parameters. 

```julia
"""
    myhash(key::String, Î²::Int64, size::Int64)::Int64

Convert a String `key` to `Int` for an array of type `size`:
"""
function myhash(key::String; Î²::Int64 = 31, size::Int64 = 1000)::Int64

    # initialize -
    hash = 0
    L = length(key)

    # main loop -
    for i âˆˆ 1:L
        hash = (hash*Î² + convert(Int, key[i])) % size
    end

    # return -
    return hash

To call this `myhash` function with the key = `CHEME-1800`, we issue the commands in the [REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/):

```julia

The `myhash` implementation above should return a value of `780` for the key = `CHEME-1800`.

### Trees
Trees are widely-used non-linear data structures that encode hierarchical structure in data that are composed of nodes and edges ({numref}`fig-tree-schematic`). 

```{figure} ./figs/Fig-Tree-Schematic.pdf
---
height: 320px
name: fig-tree-schematic
---
Schematic of a tree data structure. Each node in the tree holds some data and references (links) to its children. If a node does not have children, it is a leaf node. The topmost node in the tree is the root node.  
```

Each node may have one or more child nodes, and each child node has one or more sub-children, and so on. The topmost node, which has no parent, is called the root node, while nodes with no children are called leaf nodes. The edges connecting the nodes represent the relationships between the nodes. Finally, the number of levels of a tree is called the height of the tree.

Let's define some properties of a complete k-ary tree ({prf:ref}`defn-children-and-node-k-ary`):

````{prf:definition} Children and nodes of a full k-ary tree
:label: defn-children-and-node-k-ary

Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a full k-ary tree with height $h$ where each node of $\mathcal{T}$ has $k$ children. The height of the tree $\mathcal{T}$ will be defined as the maximum number of edges from the root node to a tree leaf. Further, let the root node of $\mathcal{T}$ have an index $0$. 

Then, the indicies of the children of node $i$, denoted by the set $\mathcal{C}_{i}$, are given by:

```{math}
:label: eqn-children-node-i
\mathcal{C}_{i}=\left\{k\cdot{i}+1,k\cdot{i}+2,\dots,k\cdot{i}+k\right\}
```

and the total number of nodes of tree $\mathcal{T}$ with branched height $h$, denoted by $N_{h}$, is given by:

```{math}
:label: eqn-number-of-nodes-kary
N_{h} = \sum_{j=0}^{h}k^j
```

where $N_{h}$ includes the final layer of leaves.

#### Common uses for trees
Trees are ubiquitous in computing; trees are used in a huge variety of applications:

* __Organizing and searching data__: Trees are commonly used to store and organize hierarchical data, such as file systems, organizational charts, and website navigation menus. The hierarchical structure of a tree makes it easy to search for specific items and perform operations like adding, deleting, or updating elements.
* __Implementing algorithms__: Many algorithms in computer science are implemented using tree data structures. For example, binary search trees enable efficient searching for an item in a sorted list. In contrast, heaps and priority queues efficiently extract the maximum or minimum element from a collection.
* __Modeling real-world phenomena__: Trees can be used to model many real-world phenomena, such as family trees, taxonomies, and decision trees. Decision trees are commonly used in machine learning to model decision-making processes and classify data based on binary decisions.

One interesting application of trees beyond what was listed above is to diagram function calls in a recursive function. Let's reimagine the recursive computation of the Fibonacci series that uses memoization ({prf:ref}`example-recursive-fibonacci-memo`):

````{prf:example} Recursive Fibonacci and Memoization
:label: example-recursive-fibonacci-memo
:class: dropdown

One tool to diagram how a recursive function works is by develiping a call tree. Previously, we constructed a [recursive implementation of the `Fibonacci` function](../unit-1-basics/functions.md) which computed the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). The call tree for recursive `fibonacci(4)` is shown in ({numref}`fig-recursive-fib-4-call-tree`):

#### Representation of Trees
Trees can be implemented in a variety of ways. Suppose we're interested in a k-ary tree $\mathcal{T}$ where each node has $k$-children. Two of the most common representations are Array-based and Adjacency list representations. 

In an array-based representation of a tree, each node is assigned an index in an array that stores the tree data. Consider a 3-ary (ternary) tree describing possible prices for a commodity as a function of time ({prf:ref}`example-ternary-price-model-array`):

````{prf:example} Ternary commodity price tree array-representation
:label: example-ternary-price-model-array
:class: dropdown

Construct a ternary pricing tree that describes a two-time step projection of a commodity price using an array-based tree representation. 

Let the current price of a commodity, e.g., a raw material required for a chemical process, be given by $P_{o}$. Assume that at each subsequent time-step in the future, the price can increase by $r_{+}$ = 2\%, stay the same $r_{0}$ = 0\%, or decrease by $r_{-}$ = 1\%.

__Solution__: The height of the tree $h$ will be the number of future time-steps. Thus, from {prf:ref}`defn-children-and-node-k-ary` we know the total number of nodes in the tree (length of the storage array) is $N_{2} = 13$. Further, we know the relationship between the parent price $P_i$ and children prices is given be:

```{math}
:label: eqn-price-set-node-i
\left\{P_{i}\left(1+r_{+}\right),P_{i},P_{i}\left(1-r_{-}\right)\right\}
```

We can now develop a `build` method that takes information about the tree and returns a list of the values of the commodity price at each node in the tree. 

__Preconditions__: The `ArrayBasedTernaryCommodityPriceTree` mutable type has been defined outside of the `build` function.

```julia
"""
    build(type::Type{ArrayBasedTernaryCommodityPriceTree};

    # initialize -
    model = ArrayBasedTernaryCommodityPriceTree(); # build an emprt tree model -
    Nâ‚• = sum([3^i for i âˆˆ 0:h]) # compute how many nodes we have in the tree
    P = Dict{Int64,Float64}() 

    # setup Î” - the amount the price moves up, or down -
    Î” = [u,0,-d];
    
    # set the root price -
    P[0] = price

    # fill up the array -
    for i âˆˆ 0:(Nâ‚• - 3^h - 1)
        
        # what is the *parent* price -
        Páµ¢ = P[i]

        # Compute the children for this node -
        Cáµ¢ = [j for j âˆˆ (3*i+1):(3*i+3)]; 
        for c âˆˆ 1:3 # for each node (no matter what i) we have three children
        
            # what is the child index?
            child_index = Cáµ¢[c]

            # compute the new *child* prive 
            P[child_index] = Páµ¢*(1+Î”[c])
        end
    end

    # set the price data on the model -
    model.data = P;

    # return -
    return model
end
```
To call this `build` function, we issue the commands in the [REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/):

```julia

````

In an adjacency list representation, the list of children at index $i$, denoted by $\mathcal{C}_{i}$, is still given by Eqn. {eq}`eqn-children-node-i`. However, instead of storing the edges and data in the same array, the edge connectivity is stored in an array or dictionary and the data stored in a seperate data structure. 

Let's reimagine the terneray commodity price model in the Adjacency list format ({prf:ref}`example-ternary-price-model-adj-list`):

````{prf:example} Ternary commodity price tree adjacency list

### Graphs
A graph is a data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges connecting these vertices. The edges can be directed (also called arcs) or undirected and can carry data ({numref}`fig-graph-schematic`). 

```{figure} ./figs/Fig-Graph-Schematic.pdf
---
height: 220px
name: fig-graph-schematic
---
Schematic of a graph data structures. Nodes in a graph hold references (called links or edges) to other nodes in the graph. The edges between node $j$ and $j$, which can be undirected (left) or directed (right), can carry data (called edge weights, $w_{ij}$) representing many different quantities, e.g., degree of interaction, physical distances, travel times, financial values, etc.    
```

Graphs represent real-world situations like networks, maps, and social relationships. They are commonly used to describe relationships between data and to solve problems such as finding the shortest path between two nodes or determining whether a graph is connected. Formally, graphs are defined in {prf:ref}`defn-graphs`:

````{prf:definition} Definition and properties of Graphs
:label: defn-graphs

A simple graph $\mathcal{G}$ is composed of a set of vertices $\mathcal{V}$ and edges $\mathcal{E}$ such that there is at most one edge between vertices $v_{i}\in\mathcal{V}$ and $v_{j}\in\mathcal{V}$, and there are no edges that connect a vertex to itself (self-loop). 

The edges in a graph can be __directed__ and __undirected__:
* In a __directed__ graph, the edges have a direction and connect one vertex to another. The edges are often used to represent relationships or dependencies between the vertices. For example, in a social network, the vertices might represent people, and the directed edges might represent friendships, with the edge pointing from the person to their friend. 
* In an __undirected__ graph, the edges have no direction and connect pairs of vertices. These edges represent connections or relationships between symmetrical vertices, such as friendships.

A graph $\mathcal{G}$ is said to be connected if there is at least one path between vertices $v_{i}\in\mathcal{V}$ and $v_{j}\in\mathcal{V}$, where a path is defined as a sequence of vertices in which each successive vertex (after the first) is connected to its predecessor.

````

#### Connection between trees and graphs
Graphs are used to model hierarchical relationships, but we have already seen that {ref}`content:references:data-structure-tree` can also be used to model hierarchical relationships. What is the difference between {ref}`content:references:data-structure-tree` and {ref}`content:references:data-structure-graphs`?
* __Structure__: A tree is a type of graph with a specific structure. Trees are connected acyclic graphs, where only one path exists between any two nodes. In contrast, a graph can have cycles and may not be connected.
Root node: A tree has a root node, the topmost node in the tree. Every other node in the tree is connected to it in some way. In a graph, there is no concept of a root node.
* __Direction__: A tree is a directed graph, which means that every edge has a direction pointing from parent to child nodes. In a graph, edges may be directed or undirected and can point to any node.
* __Complexity__: Trees are simpler than graphs because of their restricted structure. They have a unique path between any two nodes, which makes them easy to traverse and search. Conversely, graphs can be more complex and challenging to analyze because of their potentially cyclic and non-linear structure.

#### Representation of Graphs
Similar to the {ref}`content:references:data-structure-rep-tree`, graphs can be represented using Array and Adjacency list formats. The adjacency array for a graph is a two-dimensional array, i.e., a matrix instead of a vector ({prf:ref}`defn-adj-matrix-graphs`):

````{prf:definition} Adjacency matrix for graph $\mathcal{G}$
:label: defn-adj-matrix-graphs

An adjacency matrix $\mathcal{A}$ representation of a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$ is a $\dim\mathcal{V}\times\dim\mathcal{V}$ matrix holding integer or floating point values. The entry for row $i$ and column $j$ of the matrix $\mathcal{A}$, denoted $a_{ij}\in\mathcal{A}$, describes the connection between vertices $v_{i}\in\mathcal{V}$ and $v_{j}\in\mathcal{V}$. 

* __Unweighted__: If there is an edge connecting $v_{i}\in\mathcal{V}$ and $v_{j}\in\mathcal{V}$ and graph $\mathcal{G}$ is unweighted, then $a_{ij}=$ `1` (true) , otherwise $a_{ij}=$ `0` (false).
* __Weighted__: In cases where the edges of graph $\mathcal{G}$ have weights, if there is an edge connecting $v_{i}\in\mathcal{V}$ and $v_{j}\in\mathcal{V}$ and graph $\mathcal{G}$ is weighted, then $a_{ij}=w_{ij}$, otherwise $a_{ij}=$ `0` (false), where $w_{ij}\in\mathbb{R}$ denotes the weight of the edge connecting $v_{i}\in\mathcal{V}$ and $v_{j}\in\mathcal{V}$.
````

On the other hand, the adjacency list format for a graph $\mathcal{G}$ is structured in a similar way as a tree ({prf:ref}`defn-adj-list-graphs`):

````{prf:definition} Adjacency list for graph $\mathcal{G}$
:label: defn-adj-list-graphs

An adjacency list for a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$ is a $\dim\mathcal{V}$ dictionary $d$, where
the ith entry points to the children indices of vertex $v_{i}\in\mathcal{V}$, denoted by set $\mathcal{C}_{i}$. In other words, $d_{i}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}_{i}$. There is a single entry in dictionary $d$ for each vertex in graph $\mathcal{G}$.

### Tree and Graph Traversal

(content:references:data-structure-graphs-depth-first)=
#### Depth-first graph traversal
Depth-first is a graph traversal algorithm that starts at a source vertex and visits vertices by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Depth-first is often implemented using recursion but can also be implemented iteratively using a stack. 

A recursive depth-first traversal approach is outlined in {prf:ref}`algo-depth-first-traversal`.

(content:references:data-structure-graphs-breadth-first)=
#### Breadth-first graph traversal
Breadth-first is a graph traversal algorithm that visits vertices in order of their distance from a source vertex. Breadth-first starts at a source vertex and explores all the vertices at the same level before moving on to vertices at the next level. This algorithm is often implemented using a queue to keep track of the vertices to be visited.

## Summary 
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data structures are suited to various applications; some are highly specialized for specific tasks. In this lecture, we introduced several common data structures that will be important as we transition to applications.
