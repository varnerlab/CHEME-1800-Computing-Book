# Data Files and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

## Introduction
Working with data is one of the most common tasks in any computational project. For example, loading data into a program, doing some calculations using that data, and then saving the results to a file (either locally or in the cloud) describes the majority of programs you will write in this course, and likely in your future career. 

There are various tools and approaches to reading and writing data files, and for accessing data from online resources. This lecture will introduce a few common patterns, and data types and introduce some patterns for working with data from online data sources.
