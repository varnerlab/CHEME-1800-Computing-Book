This method efficiently computes the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector of a large, sparse matrix.

This method is efficient for symmetric matrices.\n",
    "* [QR iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_algorithm) applies a sequence of orthogonal similarity transformations to the matrix, which gradually transforms it into a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on the diagonal. The eigenvectors can be computed by back-substitution. This method is more expensive than power iteration but can compute all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.\n",
    "* [Singular value decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) computes a matrix’s singular values and singular vectors, which are related to its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

    "In this lecture, we discussed distance measurements and dimensionality reduction. Measurement and distance tools measure the size of matrix or vector objects and the distances between these objects. We explored two types of measurement and distance approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* {ref}`content:measurements-matrix-vector-norms` are mathematical tools to measure the magnitude of matrices and vectors, respectively. They are essential in many areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, optimization, and analysis. \n",

    "* {ref}`content:measurements-similarity-funtions` are mathematical tools that quantify the similarity between objects, such as vectors or points. They are widely used in machine learning, pattern recognition, and data analysis. One example of a similarity function is the radial basis function, which measures the distance between two points using a Gaussian distribution and is commonly used in clustering and classification algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "* {ref}`content:dimensionality-reduction` systematically reduces the number of variables in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. Dimensionality reduction simplifies data, removes noise, and makes patterns in the data more visible. It can also help visualize data, improve machine learning algorithms’ performance, and reduce the storage and computational requirements of working with large datasets."
