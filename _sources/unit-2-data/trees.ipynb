    "# Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data structures are suited to various applications; some are highly specialized for specific tasks. Some common examples of data structures that we will discuss include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear data structures\n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:lda-arrays`: An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The items can be of any data type, and each item has a unique index that can be used to access it. \n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:lda-stacks` and {ref}`content:references:lda-queues` are array like data structues that control how elements are added and accessed. {ref}`content:references:lda-stacks` follows the \n",
    "[last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)). This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are often used to store data temporarily while a program is executing. {ref}`content:references:lda-queues` follow the [first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)), the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Queues are often used to store data that needs to be processed in a specific order or to store data that is being transferred from one place to another.\n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:lda-linked-lists`: A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element is a separate object, connected to the next element by a pointer; linked lists store sequences of items, which can be expanded or contracted as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-linear data structures\n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:data-structure-hashmap-and-sets`: A hashmap is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where each key value is unique. Sets are similar to hashmaps but only store keys and do not have values associated with them.\n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:data-structure-tree`: A tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has one or more child nodes. Trees are used to store data that has a natural hierarchical structure, such as the structure of a file system or the organization of a company.\n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:data-structure-graphs`: A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges connecting the vertices. Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects, and they are often used to model networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear data structures\n",
    "Linear data structures store elements linearly, meaning that they are arranged in a sequence one after the other. This contrasts with non-linear data structures, which do not have a strict sequential order.\n",
    "\n",
    "(content:references:lda-arrays)=\n",
    "### Arrays\n",
    "An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items of the same type in a _contiguous_ block of memory ({numref}`fig-array-schematic`). The name of an array, e.g., $a$ points to the first element, then each subsequent element in the array adds `+1` units to the memory address of the previous element.   \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The items in an array are accessed using an index, an integer representing the item’s position in the collection. In most programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed, i.e., the first element in the array has an index of `0`, the second element has an index of `1`, and so on. However, arrays in [Julia](https://julialang.org) are one-based, i.e., the first element has an index `1`, the second element has an index `2`, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays can store large amounts of data because they allow fast access to any element using the index. Elements of an array are typically indexed using `bracket notation` in most languages such as [Julia](https://julialang.org) or [Python](https://www.python.org):"

Unlike an array, you cannot access the elements of a stack by thier index. Instead, elements are added to the top of the stack (also known as `pushing`) and removed from the top of the stack (also known as `popping`). \n",

    "\n",
    "###### Common uses of Stacks:\n",
    "* __Function call stack__: In programming languages, the function [call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack) is typically implemented as a stack data structure. Each time a function is called, its information (such as local variables, parameters, and return address) is pushed onto the stack. When the function returns, its information is popped off the stack, allowing the program to resume execution from where it left off.\n",
    "* __Undo/redo functionality__: Many applications that allow users to undo and redo actions use a stack data structure to keep track of the actions. Each time a user acts, such as typing a letter or moving an object, the action is added to the stack. The most recent activity is popped off the stack and undone when the user chooses to undo an action. Similarly, the redo functionality pushes undone actions back onto the stack.\n",
    "* __Expression evaluation__: Stack data structures can also be used to evaluate mathematical expressions, such as those in postfix notation. Operands are pushed onto the stack in this case, and operators are applied to the most recently pushed operands. The result is then pushed back onto the stack until the entire expression has been evaluated.\n",

    "##### Queues\n",
    "The `queue` data structure follows the [first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)), the first element added to the `queue` will be the first element to be removed ({numref}`fig-queue-schematic`).

The `dequeue!` operation removes the top element from the `queue`, i.e., the value `1` (the first item added); `dequeue!` removes elements from the `queue` in the order they were added. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Common uses of Queues\n",
    "* __Job scheduling__: Queues are often used in operating systems to manage tasks, such as running programs or printing documents. Each task is placed in a queue, and the operating system schedules tasks in the order they were added to the queue, allowing tasks to be processed in the order they were received.\n",
    "* __Breadth-first search__: In graph theory, the breadth-first search algorithm explores a graph by visiting all the vertices at a given level before moving on to the next level. This can be implemented using a queue data structure, where the vertices at each level are added to the queue in order and processed in that exact order.\n",
    "* __Message passing__: Queues are often used to pass messages between different parts of a system, such as between a producer and a consumer in a messaging system. Messages are added to the back of the queue by the producer and consumed from the front of the queue by the consumer. This allows the producer and consumer to operate at different speeds without the risk of messages being lost or overwritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the applications listed above, Queues are an ideal data structure for recursive parsing applications. Let's build a recursive string parser using a Queue ({prf:ref}`example-queue-recursive-string-parser`):\n",

    "__Solution__: We'll encode the string we need to parse in a queue data structure.

Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink as needed without complex memory management or copying operations.

    "* __Memory allocation__: In computer memory management, linked lists are used to keep track of free and allocated memory blocks. Each memory block is represented as a node in the list, with a pointer to the next block. This allows the system to find a suitable block for a new allocation quickly and to free up blocks when they are no longer needed efficiently.\n",

Thus, from {prf:ref}`defn-children-and-node-k-ary` we know the total number of nodes in the tree (length of the storage array) is $N_{2} = 13$.

The edges between node $j$ and $j$, which can be undirected (left) or directed (right), can carry data (called edge weights, $w_{ij}$) representing many different quantities, e.g., degree of interaction, physical distances, travel times, financial values, etc.    \n",

    "\n",
    "Graphs can be __directed__ and __undirected__:\n",
    "* In a __directed__ graph, the edges have a direction and connect one vertex to another. The edges are often used to represent relationships or dependencies between the vertices. For example, in a social network, the vertices might represent people, and the directed edges might represent friendships, with the edge pointing from the person to their friend. \n",

    "Root node: A tree has a root node, the topmost node in the tree. Every other node in the tree is connected to it in some way. In a graph, there is no concept of a root node.\n",
    "* __Direction__: A tree is a directed graph, which means that every edge has a direction pointing from parent to child nodes. In a graph, edges may be directed or undirected and can point to any node.\n",
    "* __Complexity__: Trees are simpler than graphs because of their restricted structure. They have a unique path between any two nodes, which makes them easy to traverse and search. Conversely, graphs can be more complex and challenging to analyze because of their potentially cyclic and non-linear structure.\n",

    "Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data structures are suited to various applications; some are highly specialized for specific tasks. In this lecture, we introduced several common data structures that will be important as we transition to applications."
