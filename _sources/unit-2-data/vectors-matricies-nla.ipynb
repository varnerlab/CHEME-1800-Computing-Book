    "# Vectors, Matrices and Linear Algebraic Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture will introduce Vectors, Matrices, and operations defined on these objects. Vectors and matrices are widely used in computer science, engineering, and other fields where mathematical modeling is essential. In chemical engineering, vectors and matrcies are used to represent physical laws such as the conservation of mass, moles or energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we begin our discussion of vectors, matrcies and their associated operations by quickly reviewing mass and mole balance equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:matrix-vector-mass-mol-balances`. Chemical Engineers use balance equations to describe, design, and troubleshoot products and processes. Balance equations describe the amount of _stuff_ (e.g., mass, moles, energy, etc.) in a _system_ that interacts with its _surroundings_. Balance equations can be represented as a system of matrices and vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we transition to defining the structure of matrices and vectors, and thier associated operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:matrix-vector` are abstract mathematical objects, typically arrays of numbers, in engineering applications. Vectors (one-dimensional arrays) often describe points in space or encode coefficients of linear equations. On the other hand, matrices (two- or more dimensional objects) typically represent data sets or a grid of numbers. However, matrices also describe linear transformations, such as rotations and scaling operations, and define systems of linear equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we consider a crucial application area, namely, the formulation and solution of systems of linear algebraic equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:soln-laes-start` arise in many different Engineering fields. In Chemical Engineering, these equations naturally arise from steady-state balance equations. We'll introduce two approaches to solving these systems of equations. \n",

    "## Review of balances\n",
    "Streams of _stuff_ (e.g., material, energy, money, information, etc.) enter (exit) a system from the surroundings; streams cross the system boundary, transporting _stuff_ into or from the system. A system is said to be _open_  if _material stuff_ can enter or exit the system; otherwise, a system is _closed_. For physical systems, streams can be pipes in which material flows into or from the system at some rate. In other cases, streams into (from) a system can carry other types of _stuff_ such as information (e.g., bits) or money (e.g., $\\$$, $\\def\\euro{\\unicode{x20AC}} \\euro$, bitcoin, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless if a system is open or closed and whatever _stuff_ is, within the system, \n",
    "_stuff_ can accumulate and be generated, e.g., via a chemical reaction or by an interest process such as a savings account or treasury bond in the case of money. Whatever the system is, and whatever _stuff_ is, the time behavior of the system can always be described by these _four_ types of terms: inputs, outputs, generation, and accumulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Open species mass balances\n",
    "If we are interested in the mass of each chemical species, we can let _stuff_ equal the mass of each of the chemical components; this choice gives the _open species mass balance_ ({prf:ref}`defn-open-species-mass-balance`):\n",

Each stream $s\\in\\mathcal{S}$ has a direction parameter $\\nu_{s}\\in\\left[-1,1\\right]$: If stream $s$ _enters_ the system $\\nu_{s} = +1$, however, if stream $s$ _exits_ the system then $\\nu_{s} = -1$.\n",

    "__Law of mass conservation__:  The [Law of Conservation of Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_mass) says that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, just rearranged or transformed. Thus, if we consume species $j$, the amount of mass-consumed must show up in the other species, i.e., the sum of the individual species mass generation terms must be zero:\n",

    "The principles of mole-based balance equations are similar to their mass-based equivalents, i.e., we can write species mole balances or total mole balances, and the terms play an equivalent role as their mass-based equivalents. However, mass-based units are generally convenient for systems that do not involve chemical reactions, and it is often easier to use mole-based units when chemical reactions occur. \n",

    "__Connection with kinetic rate__: In a concentration-based system, we often use concentration balances, and the kinetic rate laws, to describe the system. The open extent of reaction $r$ is related to kinetic rate law per unit volume $\\hat{r}_{r}$ (units: mol V$^{-1}$ t$^{-1}$):\n",
