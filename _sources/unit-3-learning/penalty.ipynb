    "* [Lasso regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters. This has the effect of setting some of the parameters to zero, which can help to select a subset of essential features and reduce the complexity of the model.\n",
    "* [Group Lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)#Group_lasso) is similar to [lasso regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) but allows the user to group variables together and applies the penalty to the group rather than to each variable.\n",
    "* [Elastic net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)#Elastic_net) combines the ridge and lasso regression penalties and allows users to tune the balance between the two penalties.\n",
