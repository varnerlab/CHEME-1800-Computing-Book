    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce functions, control statements, the concept of recursion, and error-handling patterns in this lecture: \n",
    "\n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:functions` are blocks of code that perform specifics task and may return a value. \n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:control-statements` are programming constructs that allow you to control the flow of execution of your code; further, they will enable you to create loops that repeat a block of code until a particular condition is met. \n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:recursion-functions` is a programming technique where a function calls itself with a simplified version of the original problem until the problem is small enough to be solved directly. Recursion is an essential concept in programming. It solves many problems, including search and sorting problems and problems involving recursive data structures such as trees and linked lists.\n",
    "* {ref}`content:references:error-handling` allows functions to respond to the unexpected. When an unexpected condition occurs, a function may be unable to return a reasonable value to its caller. However, error-handling patterns allow functions to respond gracefully. \n",

    "## Functions\n",
    "In programming, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task and may return a value. Functions are a fundamental building block of most programming languages, and they are used to modularize and organize code into reusable units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions allow you to write code that can be called from multiple places in your program, making your code more organized, modular, and easier to read and maintain. Functions can also accept input in the form of arguments, which are values passed to the function when it is called, and they can return a value to the caller using the return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be defined and called from anywhere in your program, and they can be called multiple times with different arguments. Thus, they are an essential tool for organizing and modularizing code in any programming project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical functions\n",
    "Most of us are familiar with the idea of a function from mathematics ({numref}`fig-mathematical-function`). A mathematical function takes input from a domain (the set of possible inputs) and converts this input to an output that lives in the codomain. The codomain is the set of all possible output values, while the range (which is a subset of the codomain) is the set of values we actually observe. \n",

    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a function from a set $X$ to a set $Y$ assigns to each element of $X$ exactly one element of $Y$. The set $X$ is the domain of the function while the set $Y$ is called the codomain of the function. A function, its domain, and its codomain, are declared using the notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "f:X\\rightarrow{Y}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where the value of a function $f$ at an element $x\\in{X}$, denoted by $f(x)$, is called the image of $x$ under $f$, or the value of $f$ applied to the argument $x$.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $f$ is the rule that describes how the inputs are transformed into results, while $y = f(x)$ denotes the output value in the range of the function $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions on the computer\n",
    "Functions on the computer share many of the features of mathematical functions, but there are a few crucial differences. For example, on the computer, a function is an object that maps a tuple of arguments to a tuple of return values. However, unlike mathematical functions, computer functions in languages such as [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org), or the [C-programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) can alter (and be affected by) the global state of your program.\n",

    "The basic syntax for defining functions in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org) or the [C-programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) involves defining a function name, the set of input (positional or keyword) arguments, the return value types, and finally, the logic (called the function body) required to transform the input arguments to the return values:\n",

    "\n",
    "The different implementations of the `linear` function share common features:\n",
    "* Each implementation has a `return y` statement at the end of the function body. A `return` statement tells the program (which is calling your function) that the work being done in the function is finished, and here is the finished value.\n",
    "* The implementation of the math $y = mx+b$ looks strikingly the same in each language; there is a conserved set of operations, e.g., the addition `+` and multiplication `*` operators defined in each language which are similar across many languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, many features are different in the `linear` function implementation between the languages:\n",
    "* [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) functions start with the `function` keyword and stop with an enclosing `end` keyword. Functions in the [C-programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) begin with the return type, and the function body is enclosed in braces `{...}`. Functions in [Python](https://www.python.org) start with the `def` keyword followed by the name, arguments, and a colon, while the return statement marks the end of a [Python](https://www.python.org) function; there is no other closing keyword or character.\n",
    "* Functions in the [C-programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) _strictly require_ type information about the arguments, but neither [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) or [Python](https://www.python.org) requires this information; it is recommended in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) but not required, and while newer [Python](https://www.python.org) versions have support for typing, the [Python](https://www.python.org) runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations.\n",
    "* [The C-programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) requires that variables be defined before they are used, while both [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) do not require this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arguments: Pass by sharing\n",
    "[Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) function arguments follow a convention called `pass-by-sharing`, i.e., values passed into functions as arguments are not copied. Instead, function arguments act as new variable bindings (new locations that can refer to values), but the underlying values they refer to are identical to the passed values ({prf:ref}`rem-modifications-args`): \n",
    "\n",
    "````{prf:remark} Pass-by-sharing\n",
    ":label: rem-modifications-args\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pass-by-sharing` paradigm leads to interesting (and sometimes confusing) side effects: Modifications made to mutable values within the function body are visible to the caller (outside the function).\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is found in many other languages such as [Scheme](https://www.scheme.org), [Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), and [Perl](https://www.perl.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arguments: Default and keyword arguments\n",
    "It is often possible (and desirable) to provide sensible default values for function arguments. Providing default values saves users from passing every argument on every call. Let's re-write the `linear` function with default values for the function arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "    linear(x::Number, m::Number = 0.0, b::Number = 0.0) -> Number\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the linear transform of the scalar number `x`\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "function linear(x::Number, m::Number = 0.0, b::Number = 0.0)::Number\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # linear transform the x-value\n",
    "    y = m*x+b\n",
    "\n",
    "    # return y \n",
    "    return y\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "# call: we can call with only *two* args\n",
    "y = linear(2.0,3.0) # this should return 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions need a large number of arguments or have a large number of behaviors. Remembering how to call such functions can take time and effort. Keyword arguments make these complex interfaces easier to use and extend by allowing arguments to be identified by name instead of by position. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the `linear` function written with keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "    linear(x::Number; slope::Number = 0.0, intercept::Number = 0.0) -> Number\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the linear transform of the scalar number `x` given values for \n",
    "the `slope` and `intercept` keyword arguments. All arguments are of type `Number`\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "function linear(x::Number; slope::Number = 0.0, intercept::Number = 0.0)::Number\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # map keyword values to previous parameters\n",
    "    m = slope\n",
    "    b = intercept\n",
    "\n",
    "    # linear transform the x-value (set to y)\n",
    "    y = m*x+b\n",
    "\n",
    "    # return y \n",
    "    return y\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "# call: we can call with 1, 2 or 3 args\n",
    "y = linear(2.0; slope = 2.0, intercept=0.1) # this should return 4.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions as contracts\n",
    "A function can also be considered a contract between a developer and a user. The developer defines the function and specifies how it should behave, while the user relies on it to perform as described. The developer ensures that the function is written correctly and behaves as intended, while the user is responsible for providing the correct input and understanding the output. To facilitate this contract, consider a few items:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A well-defined function must have clear input and output specification documentation, making it easy for the user to understand. Clear and informative documentation is critical to promote efficient and effective communication between the developer and the user. It can make it easier for the user to trust the developer's work. \n",
    "* Function naming is also critical because it helps to clearly and accurately communicate the purpose and behavior of the function.\n",
    "* Finally, good variable and constant names make your code more readable and understandable, making it easier for other developers (and even yourself) to understand what the variable or constant represents just by reading its name.\n",

    "\n",

    "## Control statements\n",
    "Control statements are an essential part of programming. Control statements allow you to create programs that make decisions and perform tasks based on certain conditions.
