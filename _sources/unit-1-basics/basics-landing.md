# Technical computing basics
In this unit, we introduce basic technical computing concepts and tools:

* [Variables, expressions, and types](./types.md): A variable is a named location in memory that stores a value. An expression is a combination of variables, literals, and operators that can be evaluated to a single value. For example, the expression "x + 2" would add the value stored in the variable x to 2. Types are categories that identify the kind of value an expression produces. For example, the expression "2 + 3" produces an integer value of the "int" type. Other types include "float" (for decimal values), "str" (for string values), and "bool" (for Boolean values).
* [Functions](./functions.md) are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be called (invoked) by name. Functions can accept input arguments (parameters) and may return a value or result.
* [Programs and modules](./programs.md) are collections of computer code. A computer program is a set of instructions that a computer can execute to perform a specific task or solve a problem. On the other hand, a module is a file containing code that can be imported into a program or another module. Modules allow you to reuse code across multiple programs and projects.
* [File and Data I/O](./data-file-io.md) refers to input/output operations involving files or other data sources such as application programming interfaces. Simple File I/O operations allow you to read from and write to files on your computer's filesystem. For example, you might use File I/O to read data from a text file or save a programâ€™s results to a file.
