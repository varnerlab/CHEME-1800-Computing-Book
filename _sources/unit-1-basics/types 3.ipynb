    "# Expressions, Variables and Types\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lecture, we introduce expressions, variables, and types. Expressions are combinations of variables and values that can be evaluated to a single value. Variables are symbols that represent values, which can be changed or assigned to different values. Types refer to the kind of value that a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, or strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many traditional programming languages, it is required to declare the variable type before using it so that the computer, i.e., the [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) or [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) that is processing your code, can check the correctness of the program and allocate the appropriate amount of memory to store the variable. While most modern languages can guess (or infer) the type, declaring types is still good practice because it helps with the readability of the compute code.  \n",

    "## Expressions\n",
    "Expressions are a combination of values, variables, and operators that _evaluate_ to a single value. Expressions are a fundamental building block of most programming languages, and they are used to perform calculations, compare values, and assign values to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common examples of expressions in the [Julia programming language](https://docs.julialang.org):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `2 + 3`: This expression evaluates to the value 5, an `integer`. \n",
    "* `x * y`: This expression evaluates to the product of the variables x and y.\n",
    "* `x == y`: This expression evaluates to `true` if x and y are equal and `false` if they are not; `true` and `false` are Boolean types.\n",
    "* `x > y`: This expression evaluates to `true` if x is greater than y, and `false` if it is not; `true` and `false` are Boolean types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions evaluate to a value that has a type. Expressions can be used independently or as part of a larger statement. For example, expressions can be arguments to a function or assigned to a variable using the assignment operator `=`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables and Types\n",
    "A _variable_ is like a box that holds a value, and that value has a _type_. For example, types can be numbers such as `3`, Boolean values like `true` or `false` or text like:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Your computer is the only thing in the universe that unconditionally loves you, perhaps excluding your mother. Your computer will do anything you ask it to do with no pushback and no attitude. You just need to know how to talk to it!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, computers and Humans don't speak the same language. Humans understand that `3` is an integer, and `Julia rocks` is text, but the computer doesn't see these values the same way we do. For a computer, everything is a [binary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number), i.e., numbers written to the `base 2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this perspective, integers are binary numbers, text is a set of binary numbers, Boolean values are binary numbers, etc. At the smallest scale, information is stored as bits and bytes in the computer ({numref}`fig-64-bit-byte-label-example`)\n",

    "Schematic of bytes and bits used in computer storage. Each box contains a digit in the numbering system. In a binary system each box contains a `0` or `1`. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A `bit` is the smallest unit of storage on a computer; a `bit` is a `0` or a `1`. However, a `bit` is too tiny for practical computing tasks. Instead, `bits` are grouped into `bytes`; a group of 8 bits equals  1 $\\times$ `byte`. Different types of things, e.g., integers or text are then represented as different numbers of `bytes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types are an essential concept in programming, and they are used to ensure the correctness and efficiency of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical and logical types\n",
    "Integers, floating-point, and logical values are the basic building blocks of arithmetic and computation. Built-in representations of these values, i.e., the structure that the computer understands, are called `numeric primitives.` On the other hand, the models of numbers that humans understand, e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, etc., are called numeric literals, e.g., `1` is an integer literal, and `1.0` is a floating-point literal. Modern programming languages such as [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) and [Python](https://www.python.org) provide a broad range of primitive numeric types. Further, many standard mathematical operations are defined over them, e.g., addition and subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric primitives, which the computer understands, are binary numbers (numbers written to the `base 2`). However, there are other number systems that you may encounter, e.g., numbers written in the `base 8` (octal) or `base 16` (hexadecimal) system ({prf:ref}`defn-number-system`):\n",

However, foundational languages such as the [C-programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) do not have a dedicated Boolean type; instead, Boolean values in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) were represented by integers, i.e., `true = 1` and `false = 0`. Thus, it should not be surprising that in languages such as [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org), which is a distant relative of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), that `Bool` is implemented as a subtype of integer. \n",

Modern languages, such as [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) or [Python](https://www.python.org), have sophisticated built-in `String` types constructed using the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) character set.  `Strings` can be created using double quotes in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) or single quotes in [Python](https://www.python.org):\n",

    "However, while the types of characters that can be incorporated into a [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) `String` is more diverse, in many ways, modern strings share features with the older array representation of text. For example, a [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) (or [Python](https://www.python.org)) `String` can be indexed like an array:"

You define a struct by using the `struct` keyword followed by a name for the struct and a list of field names and types. For example, let's define an immutable `Student` struct that has a `sid` and a `netid` field:\n",

    "# build an instance -\n",
    "student = Student(1,\"xyz123\"); # we pass the required data into the struct as args \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A mutable struct is a struct whose fields can be modified after it is created. You can create a mutable struct by using the `mutable struct` keyword instead of struct and by adding a _constructor_ method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "mutable struct Student\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # data fields \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The struct composite data type contains only data; in the examples above the `Student` datatype holds two values, `sid` is an integer type and `netid` is a string type. Except for the special case of the constructur on the mutable `Student` struct, composite types in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org) do not have functions attached to them. \n",

    "#### Aside: What is an object-oriented language?\n",
    "In other mainstream programming languages, e.g., [Python](https://www.python.org), [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) or [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) composite types also have named functions associated with them, and the combination is called an `object`. In purer object-oriented languages, such as [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) or [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk), all values are objects whether they are composites or not. In less refined object-oriented languages, including [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/), some values, such as integers and floating-point values, are not objects, while instances of user-defined composite types are true objects with associated methods. In [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org), all values are objects, but functions are not bundled with the objects they operate on. \n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "In this lecture, we introduced expressions, variables, and types. Understanding expressions, variables, and types are fundamental to writing programs in any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that produce a new value when evaluated. \n",
    "* Variables are named storage locations that can hold values and are used to store values that may change during the execution of a program. \n",
    "* Types are categories of values, and every value belongs to a specific type. Programming languages have many different types, including primitive types (such as numbers and booleans) and composite types (such as arrays and objects). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we build upon our introduction of expressions, variables, and types and consider some other technical computing build blocks and strategies, namely [Functions, Control Statements, and Recursion](./functions.md)."
